# Email-Phishing
An email phishing Python app I made utilizing a data set I found on Kaggle and many different Python libraries.


üõ†Ô∏è How Does It Work?

Preprocessing Magic: The classifier first preprocesses email content, focusing on text normalization and stopwords removal.

EML Extraction: It skillfully extracts text from .eml files, ensuring no crucial information is missed, even in multipart emails.

Smart Learning: The core is a Naive Bayes classifier trained with a TF-IDF vectorizer, adept at discerning subtle patterns in textual data.

User-Friendly Design: I've made it convenient to use ‚Äì load an .eml file, and the classifier predicts its nature in moments.

üìà Behind the Scenes:
Developing this tool involved overcoming challenges in natural language processing and understanding the nuances of email formats. It was a fantastic learning experience in Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, and more.

üéØ Why This Matters?
In the era of rampant cyber threats, this tool isn't just a technical endeavor; it's a step towards safer digital communication. It aims to reduce the risk of phishing attacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated.

# How to use
Clone the Repository:
First, they need to clone your repository to their local machine. This can be done using Git with the command:
git clone https://github.com/SamuelSara/PhishFinder.git

Install Required Libraries:

pandas

nltk

scikit-learn

joblib

Download NLTK Resources:
The script uses NLTK for text processing, so users need to download the necessary NLTK resources (like punkt and stopwords). This can be done in Python:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

Prepare Data:
Users should have their email data in the format your script expects. If your script uses a CSV file for training (like 'Phishing_Email.csv'), they need a similar structured file.

Run the Script:
Execute the script. If it's designed to be run from a command line, it might look something like this:
python script_name.py 

Using the Classifier:
To classify new emails, users should follow the function or method you've provided. For example, if they have an .eml file they want to classify, they would use your predict_eml function.

Review Output:
After running the script, users should check the output, which will classify the email as either phishing or legitimate.
