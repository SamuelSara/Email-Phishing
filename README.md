# Email-Phishing
An email phishing Python app I made utilizing a data set I found on Kaggle and many different Python libraries.


🛠️ How Does It Work?

Preprocessing Magic: The classifier first preprocesses email content, focusing on text normalization and stopwords removal.
EML Extraction: It skillfully extracts text from .eml files, ensuring no crucial information is missed, even in multipart emails.
Smart Learning: The core is a Naive Bayes classifier trained with a TF-IDF vectorizer, adept at discerning subtle patterns in textual data.
User-Friendly Design: I've made it convenient to use – load an .eml file, and the classifier predicts its nature in moments.
📈 Behind the Scenes:
Developing this tool involved overcoming challenges in natural language processing and understanding the nuances of email formats. It was a fantastic learning experience in Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, and more.

🎯 Why This Matters?
In the era of rampant cyber threats, this tool isn't just a technical endeavor; it's a step towards safer digital communication. It aims to reduce the risk of phishing attacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated.
